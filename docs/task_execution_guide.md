# Task Execution Guide

## Overview

The Task Execution feature of AgenticSeek allows users to split complex tasks into manageable steps and execute them autonomously. This guide provides details on how to utilize this functionality effectively while ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently.

## Features
- **Task Splitting**: Break down a complex task into smaller, actionable steps.
- **Autonomous Execution**: Execute tasks without manual intervention, enhancing productivity.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensures that all tasks are executed locally, maintaining user privacy.

## How It Works

1. **Define Your Task**: Start by defining your main task. This can be anything from web browsing to coding or planning.
2. **Split the Task**: The system will analyze the main task and suggest smaller tasks to complete.
3. **Execution**: Once the smaller tasks are confirmed, the system will execute them autonomously, reporting progress along the way.

## Example Usage

```python
from sources.interaction import TaskPlanner

# Define a complex task
main_task = "Create a presentation on AI usage in modern applications"

# Initialize the Task Planner
task_planner = TaskPlanner()

# Split the task
sub_tasks = task_planner.split_task(main_task)

# Execute the tasks
for task in sub_tasks:
    task_planner.execute_task(task)
```

## Error Handling

In case of any issues during task execution, the system will log errors and provide feedback for troubleshooting. Ensure you check the logs for any failed tasks and their reasons. 

## Conclusion

The Task Execution feature is a powerful tool designed to enhance productivity by automating complex tasks. For further assistance, refer to the documentation on troubleshooting and error handling.
