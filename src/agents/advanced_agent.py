advanced_agent.py

This module implements the advanced agent logic for improved task handling in the AgenticSeek project.

The advanced agent is responsible for analyzing user requests, selecting appropriate actions, and coordinating with other agents
or resources to fulfill complex tasks autonomously. This enhances the task execution process, allowing for better performance
and user satisfaction.
